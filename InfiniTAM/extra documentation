# Hotkeys
    * w - should save the scene as mesh to disk (this crashes currently)
    * f - freeview (navigation in freeview is weird)


# IP addresses
The drone program needs two ip addresses to run
    1. IP address for the royale tcp server (by default this uses port 5000)
    2. IP address for the DJI Control Server on the android device

    These should be able to set in the InfiniTAM.cpp atleast. Maybe also set them through CLI.
